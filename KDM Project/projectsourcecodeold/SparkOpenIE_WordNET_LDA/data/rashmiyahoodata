my voice well i think i have quite a good voice for singing but the problem is i cant sing too high notes or too low notes i'm in the middle and its really annoying me because most female voices i hear are high so i can't really sing along to some songs without sounding like i'm screaming really badly anyone have any advice on how i can train my voice to go higher at home in my spare time thanks alot i really appreciate it d also why does it crack usually i'm by the way cracking comes from lack of air support if you sound like you are screaming it could be that you are not a true soprano or that you are singing in what is called the chest voice everyday do some kind of vocal exercise extend your range step each week support your voice with lots of air controlled by the diaphram muscle

i dont know if i have a good voice or not i want to sing and become an actress everyone i ask though doesnt take me seriously i dont know what to do they say oh you'll get over the want in a couple years but thats not true i want to do this what can i do i have the same dreams i can tell you this i just recently started singing but if u have problems with range hum at a really high note because u will be making ur vocal chords stronger it should be high enough so that al you mite hear is air or a squeaky weird noise try this for a couple of mins everyday until u tart to hear a stronger noise or any noise at all this really works iwent two notes higher and lower but do not strees or strain your vocal chords by doin them for too long also get a voice coach and as for acting go to sum acting classes and look in front of the mirror everyday and choose a scene to act out with this u will get better and its true practice makes perfect i agree with the answer b that you should have something to fall back on just in case lol im shure ull do just fine gud luck

singing is it normal to think that you have a better singing voice when you are singing with another singer on a cd and with backround music rather then just singing with nothing yes sometimes it is because you are hearing the other person who sounds good and sometimes it is because it is easy for you to hit the right notes when someone else is singing them too singing without music is very hard sometimes because it is easier to lose forget the note you need to hit practice with and then without over and over your without will get better and better

singing problem ok well i love singing ad music and my goal is to create an album of all my songs the only problem is i dont like my own voice i think my music and lyrics are fine just my voice what should i do i already take singing lessons i'm a music education voice major the hartt school of music in connecticut something they teach us is that everyone can sing the problem with that is we psych ourselves into thinking we are bad singers just because you don't like the sound of your voice doesn't mean you don't sound good i can speak from experience i never like the sound of my own voice on a recording but i continue to do it so i can get used to the sound of my own voice i encourage you to bring this question to you voice teacher if you are in lessons and play something you recorded to your teacher odds are they will say it is an accurate representation of your voice and that you are being your own harshest critic with singing we are our own worst enemies the best we can do is smile and continue to let the music take us on a ride sing and be proud that you are doing it

can someone help me so i love singing and my music teacher told me i have a beautiful voice but i never show it off the only time i sing out loud is when im alone or the music is really loud i really want to get a record deal or be on disney channel what some ways to get used to singing when people can hear me omg a blast from the past when i was in high school i was told the same thing i joined the chorus and was singled out to try for a state wide competition i agreed to do it simply because i wanted to sing and had to get over this nervousness the try outs were in a room of judges with their backs to you this helped as nobody had to actually look at me i got in the competition and that rose my confidence a bit however as i got older i was still afraid to sing in front of people by your statement disney channel i'm guessing you're kind of young to be going out to karaoke bars but that's where i shook off the nervousness i picked a song i knew real well and although the microphone was shaking from my hand i did a great job now i sing in a band solo all the time with no nerves at all the thing is when you've got a great voice and you get complimented on it you should go with it and trust it if they don't like your voice they wouldn't say anything at all swallow the nerves because you won't get anywhere if you let them take over join a chorus group if you have friends that like to sing maybe start your own little vocal group in school with the aid of a teacher and see if you can get a quartet song during chorus concerts make sure each person has a small solo in the song but standing up with friends will help get the nerves down a bit because you'll have a support team don't forget your parents and siblings they will support you too that's important don't ever let go of a dream pursue it to the end

what are some good songs that i can sing too im good at singing to like kelly clarkson and rihanna songs that you are comfortable singing are what will impress your audience but if you go too far it could just end up corny believe me experience try songs by mariah carey kelly clarkson and maybe even whitney houston if you have the vocal range also try looking up a singer named nina she's from the philippines but all her songs are in english she has a style like kelly clarkson too it always depends on your vocal range you want to make your performance sound pleasing to the ear and you don't want to try hard a few facts don't ever try and clear your throat before singing unless it's mandatory drink lukewarm water not cold and try a menthol mint before going up on stage just make sure you finish it before you sing figure out what song suits each occasion and choose your singer it also depends on the mood of your voice if you're looking for lower vocal range then aim for songs by rihanna but by the way you said that you sing like kelly clarkson i'm guessing you do have the range look up some country singers too like faith hill or carrie underwood also if i ain't got you by alicia keys is a good song i hope this was helpful karina

how do i know if i'm singing in key i am rhythm guitar for my band an i want to do some background vocals and stuff how do i know if i'm singing in key my ear is pretty good since i've been playing guitar obsessively for a little over a year and it sounds to me like i'm in key but my friend the singer tells me i'm a little too low any help would be appreciated well singing lower than the song's register is not singing out of key singing in key is different it means you are way off and have no ear for music registers if people are looking at you with a pained expression on their faces you're off key to get an idea of whether or not you're in key block ear and sing along if you have any musical ability whatsoever you'll be able to tell yourself

i would like to sing but i think i am too young and i am scared to sing in front of anyone but my family i can sing infront of my family and sometimes my friends but i am too scared what can i do to get rid of my fear i am also only years old too young pfft there's no such thing as too young to sing think about that one girl that one america's got talent she was only i think most professional singers say they've been singing as long as they can remember just go for it as for being scared to sing there's nothing to be scared about believe it or not when your voice changes tones when you ask a question or imitate somebody or whatever you're singing singing is pretty much just changing tones and notes and stuff while you're talking there are plenty of techniques you can google or get from a teacher to help with stage fright don't worry about it it is very common think of it this way if everyone would be scared to sing where would the world be right now it is said that music helps you through hard times and has gotten people through events and it's inspired so many people if every body was afraid to sing where would that inspiration or help be and would it be as effective if people like beyonce or mary j blige etc etc was too scared to ever put their amazing talent out there i would be missing somethin in my life there was this woman i knew that had an amazing voice and her son died and she then didn't want to sing because it would remind her of her son she eventually had a few things happen medically that made it so she could hardly talk let alone sing singing is an amazing gift and if you don't use it god will want it back haha put it out there who knows what will happen good luck

over singing i have some swelling inside of my throat on the right side i'm in a band and i've been doing lots of vocal practice i think the other day i over did it a bit did my over singing the cause of my swelling i've stop talking and it got a little better i don't have a cold or anything first of all does this swelling cause you difficulties when you swallow if it does then it is probably not directly voice related but rather can be a minor infection of your throat like laryngitis these things don't pose a danger to the singing voice unless you continue to sing with it i'd check it out with your doctor overwork will make you feel vocally tired hoarse and sluggish but should not cause visible damage unless you really outdid yourself and broke the record for shireking or something silly like that check it out with uncle doc who will tell you take some vocal rest anyways if he finds that it is an infection be good and take all the medication as well a half cured infection will cause the same amount of damage as a full fledged one speedy recovery

what does my singing need to improve http youtube com watch v ruku ewz mode user search first video of me singing not the best song vocal range wise i guess but if you could tell me what is good and what is bad im in the tie dye also check out my other videos subscribe if you likey not too bad first thing's first sing from your diaphragm ever watch sister act get a sheet of paper start out with a lightweight one first and then move up to construction paper place it on the wall in front of you and then keep it up on the wall by blowing on it for as long as you can try to get your lungs trained so you can hold those longer notes always try out other styles of music i've gone from singing sicut cervus by palestrina and hodie which are choir songs that i did at school to aretha franklin gwen stefani the old no doubt t a t u and my personal favorite hanson which are less challenging for your vocal range and more challenging as far as hitting the right notes at the right time and saying the words so they're understandable oh and never try slipknot or otep before you go on to sing trust me if you've got a keyboard there are a ton of excercises you could do not just the do re mi types you should also practice jumping from note to note by singing c e g c g e c and going up and each scale several times it's a good warm up the last thing i can think of is diction pronouncing words clearly is very important if you're going to be a good singer otherwise you should just tear up your vocal cords by going into metal or metalcore just kidding good luck you sound great

how can i improve my vocal range i am years old and cant go very high while singing and sound good when i sing lower notes like middle c i sound amazing but just a few notes above and i cant reach it with a good voice i sound kind like hannah montana at the lower notes and i love it but i sing all of her songs right anyone have any ideas those who diss hannah montana i will ignore cuz she is my fave singer in the whole world o and im also kinda shy so i dont really let a bunch of people hear my voice but it will probably get better the shy thing through high school soo vocal teachers are out at the time you have to really practice and it's all about heart you can sing like an angel but if you are'nt enjoying it or are nervous it can make a huge difference i set aside time where i go in my room shut the door and find a song i like and i'll learn it and then sing it about times but don't be discouraged you can improve your voice it just takes time

i am years old i want to be a singer realy bad like hannah montana how do i do it i am years old well the last thing you want to be is a 'fake musician' that would be hannah montanna she was chosen by disney just like hilary duff and lindsay lohan she didn't purposely get signed disney picked her out but thats not my point i think the best way to get into the music buisness is get some lessions learn how to sing the real way with an instructor and its also good to learn another intrument like guitar or piano that way you have something to go along with your singing and if your going to be a solo act its much better then start singing and playing practive alot write some songs then play at a few local coffee shops get permission from a few places to play outside their shop also sens your ten hardly anyone is going to take you siriously i am a young singer songwritter myself around to ish so act very proffesional and anyone who thinks your a joke can deal with it ignore the ignorant haters are a waste of time don't worry about openions also dont just get into this because you want to be a famous popstar thats not what music is about its not about fame money being cool or anything like that its about playing music and expressing yourself if your in this to be famous let it go its not for you plus people like me the real musicians who couldn't care less about fame will make fun of you but really if your in this for fame just let it go let your popstar time be daydreaming in your room with music i look down on people who strive to be famous i am not trying to be famous but nor am i avoiding it i don't care it would be nice to be rich and have alot of fans but i would also be perfectly happy with a small handfull of supportive fans it makes me sad how there are hardly any musicians nowdays who play for playing thats all i can think of so there you go
